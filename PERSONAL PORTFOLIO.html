          <h2>HEY, I AM SHANTEL!</h2>
          <p>
            I have always been passionate about activities that allow me to
            expand my creative mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether it's listening to music, painting, or crocheting, I have
            consistently sought out new and enriching experiences. My
            professional goal is to design and develop visually appealing and
            user-friendly web applications. I am enthusiastic about embracing
            new challenges and growing through hands-on experience and
            collaborative efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the rapid advancements in technology, I view this as an
            opportune time to delve into new and unexplored areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have recently embarked on my journey to learn HTML and CSS, and I
            am eager to deepen my knowledge in these foundational web
            technologies. I am committed to continuous learning and make it a
            priority to regularly explore new technologies and methodologies to
            enhance my skill set. Although I do not yet have notable projects or
            achievements to showcase, I am dedicated to building a robust
            portfolio that will reflect my growth and expertise in the field.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to the
            possibility of connecting and collaborating on exciting projects in
            the future!

            <strong>Description:</strong> A cafe menu that represents
            the culmination of my journey in the Codedex The Origins I: HTML
            course. Inspired by the dream of owning a cozy corner cafe within a
            bookstore, it captures the essence of a warm and inviting spot. The
            logo, crafted using free graphics from Canva, features an adorable
            bear in front of a honeycomb with a bumblebee, adding a whimsical
            touch. The menu offers a diverse selection of pastries and drinks,
            thoughtfully curated to satisfy a variety of tastes and preferences.

            minimalistic aesthetic with red, black and white being the main
            colors. The image in the header is another free graphic from Canva
            of a woman with headphones which is meant to represent me. This
